This is the second lab completed for the course. The lab consists of solving two problems from Topcoder in the way specified by the instructor.
The problem statements are found here:

part 1 - OneDimensionalBalls:

SRM-496-Driver.cpp and SRM-337-Driver.cpp were written by Dr. James Plank at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville to facilitate the testing of the solution of part 1, 2 respectively.
The problems were solved with C++ 95 and compiled with g++.


to test part 1
command line:

g++ SRM-496-Driver.cpp
./a.out 0

should print: 3




to test part 2
command line:

g++ SRM-337-Driver.cpp
./a.out 2

should print: 104858900000
