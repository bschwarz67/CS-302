this is the 7th lab done for the course. This time he didnt give us much of a guide, just let us go. Our job was to read a file that specified a maze, for example:

ROWS 3 COLS 4
WALL 7 11
WALL 10 9
WALL 1 0
WALL 1 2
WALL 5 9
WALL 6 2

With this data, we were to create a graph to represent the maze and use depth first search to solve it. The output after solving should have the data from the input file, although
it doesnt have to be ordered the same, and the path used to solve the maze. The path is shown as one maze "cell" id on each line. To continue the example above: 

ROWS 3 COLS 4
WALL 1 0
WALL 1 2
WALL 5 9
WALL 6 2
WALL 7 11
WALL 10 9

The lab was done in C++ 98
to test-
g++ -std=c++98  MazeSolver.cpp
./a.out < test0.txt

should see:
ROWS 5 COLS 5
WALL 0 5
WALL 1 6
WALL 2 7
WALL 3 8
WALL 6 11
WALL 7 12
WALL 8 13
WALL 9 14
WALL 10 11
WALL 12 13
WALL 15 16
WALL 16 17
WALL 17 18
WALL 18 19
WALL 21 22
WALL 23 24
