lab 8 done for Dr. Plank's CS-302 Data Structures and Algorithms 2 class at UT Knoxville. This lab was to implement a program that reads a graph 
representing a network of streets and intersections from a file and use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from intersection (0,0) to 
intersection (largest_street#, largest_avenue#). Three slightly different versions of Dijkstra's algorithm are implemented depending on time spent 
at the light in each intersection.

 full lab description is here: https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs302/Labs/Lab8/

 city_map_base.cpp and city_map.hpp were written by Dr. Plank.

 to compile: run make in home directory for the lab
 
 From lab writeup:
 "
 command line: city_map none|best|worst|avg time|print|jgraph - map on standard input
 time -- This simply prints out the time of the fastest path. If none was specified, this prints zero.
 print -- This prints out all of the nodes of the graph, and then the path.
"
 jgraph doesnt work in my implementation because I couldnt get the binary that Dr. Plank wrote.
