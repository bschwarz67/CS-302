I completed this assignment for purposes on independent study of the course CS 302 Fundamental Algorithms taught by Dr James Plank at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 

Lab Info found here: https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs302/Labs/Lab5/

not included are the binarys for Dr. Plank's disjoint set implementation. Information on these binaries as well as how to compile everything is found in the lab page for the course. Other files Dr. Plank has written are found in that directory as well.
