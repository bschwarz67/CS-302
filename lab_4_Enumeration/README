This is the 4th lab done for the course. In this lab, we had to create a program that takes a command line of W, E, and 'x' or 'h' and generates every 
possible WxW matrix configuration where there is only 1 X in each row and column, and there E Es, and the rest of the indexes are '.' 
Each matrix should be printed according to the format specified by 'x' or 'h.' If 'x' each matrix is printed as described above, where each row of the
matrix is on its own line, and there is a space in between matrices. If 'h', we generate a hexidecimal number for every row where the if the ith index of 
the row is X or E, we maje the ith bit of the hexidecimal number 1. Each number is printed on its own line, and each set of numbers representing a matrix 
is separated by a space.


The lab was done in C++ 98

command line: ./a.out W E FORMAT='x' or 'h'


to test-
g++ -std=c++98  enumeration.cpp
./a.out 2 1 x

should see:
